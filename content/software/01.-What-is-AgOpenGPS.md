## AgOpenGPS

AgOpenGPS is an open source windows program that can be used in cab for
autosteer, guidance, section control, and many other features that are typically
found in expensive name brand precision agriculture companies. The difference is
there are even more forward thinking features built in to this program and yet
more in development. And these are built by farmers for farmers!

This program was first written by Brian Tischler who made it available to all
who are interested in learning more about coding and electronics and how they
can benefit farmers all over the world.

We don't want anyone to get hurt or sued so below you'll find a disclaimer. If
you choose to install this stuff on your Ag. Equipment, do so at your own risk.

## What hardware is required?

Not as much as you'd think! For a quick answer to this question, see the handy
[Getting Started guide](/getting-started) and all things hardware related, visit
the [Hardware section of the documentation](/hardware).

## Disclaimer

- Important \*

This software is for discussion and learning of Precision Ag algorithms and
techniques. It is not in any way to be used on any physical equipment and is
meant for use by a simulator only.

Any use of AgOpenGPS on real physical equipment is not allowed and is not
recommended in any way, neither off road or on road.

It is completely unsafe and has no safety limits built in or implied.

AgOpenGPS is strictly an example of C# programming for demonstration purposes
only and shall not be used for any other purpose.

Ag Precision Mapping and Section Control Software

This software reads NMEA strings for the purpose of recording and mapping
position information for Agricultural use. Also it has up to 16 Sections to
control implements application of product preventing over-application.

Included is an Installer with all the necessary files along with UDP, TCP/IP,
and serial NMEA simulators.
