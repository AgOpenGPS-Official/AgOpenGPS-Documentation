Step 1 of the software setup process is to install the AgOpenGPS software. There
are two guides to help you achieve this. The video guide is recommended as a
starting point. The text based guide is recommended as a supplementary resource,
if required.

## Install - video guide

To achieve this, it is highly recommended to watch
[section 1 of the setup video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiyDXU-lgrM).
Watch from 00:00-03:10 for install, though the whole video is relevant to
getting your system fully up and running!

To follow along with section 1, download the
[latest release of AgOpenGPS](https://github.com/AgOpenGPS-Official/AgOpenGPS/releases).

The linked video above also introduces 'AOGConfigomatic', a handy program to
simplify configuring your Teensy and GNSS receiver. You can
[download AOGConfigomatic here](https://github.com/lansalot/AOGConfigOMatic/releases).
If you have already done this, or have configured firmware through other
methods, don't worry - just be sure you've configured them correctly to avoid
headaches in the future!
