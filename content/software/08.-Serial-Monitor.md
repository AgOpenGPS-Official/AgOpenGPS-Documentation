   Teensy and 38400 for Arduino.

2. If you touch the "Log" button - it will show you the incoming NMEA sentence
   data to AgIO.

3. You can save what was displayed to a log file zAgIO_SerialMon_log.txt saved
   in the main program folder.

5. Help. Brings up this page in the Wiki.

6. If the Ethernet Setup dialog is open, and the Serial Monitor, and you are
   connected to the Nano USB of the steer module, you will be able to see a few
   diagnostic items like IP and Subnet, ADS1115 count value, Current A/D Value,
   and the Switch Byte. It gets updated every 2 seconds as the Scan is sent to
   the module.
