## Main Display

![AgIO Normal Display](../img/agio.png)

This section describes the main AgIO window and its key areas:

1. **RTK Information Area** – Displays real-time kinematic (RTK) status and
   related information. Specifically:

   - The amount of data shared during the RTK session (in this instance 1,415
     Kb)
   - The status of the connection (in this instance 'listening', but can also be
     'authorizing' or 'waiting')
   - The time the connection has been live (in this instance 67 mins). If
     connecting, it will count down until a connection attempt is made. You can
     tap this outlined box to pause/halt the RTK connection, and press again to
     restart it.

2. **UDP Networking Area** – Displays UDP connection status and associated
   connected IP addresses. Tap the UDP port icon to configure networking. If the
   button is not green, a dialog prompts you to enable UDP. Tap the UDP button
   and confirm. (Linux users: this is where you can change the loopback
   address.)

   ![UDP Networking Dialog](../img/agio-ethernet.png)

3. **Modules and Status** – Each icon represents a module. Tap an icon to open a
   dialog for connecting to serial ports.

   Icon colors indicate status:

   - **Green:** Communicating normally
   - **Red:** Lost communication after being connected
   - **No color:** Not connected this session
   - The small numbers beside the GPS icon show data bytes sent and received.

4. **Flyout Button** – Tap to expand and view the full AgIO display (see next
   section).

5. **Position Information** – Tap the icon to view a dialog with all NMEA
   information.

At the bottom is the menu bar. The icon at the far right launches AgOpenGPS.

## Main Display (expanded view)

![AgIO Full Display](../img/agio-full.png)

The full display provides detailed information and controls:

1. **Show/Hide Modules** – Hide unused modules by tapping 'X'. Tap '+' to
   restore them.
2. **RTK Caster IP Address and Mount** – Displays the IP address, mount, and
   packet bytes sent.
3. **Steer Module Information** – Shows steering angle, raw A/D converter
   counts, and switch status (updates once per second).
4. **Machine Module Section Status** – Displays section on/off status. If
   sections do not change to '1' when activated, check for issues.
5. **RTK Parsing** – Provides a rough estimation of station ID and sentences
   found. Note: RTK is complex; this is for reference only.
6. **Shutdown Icon** – Tap to shut down Windows and power off the computer.
7. **Log Creation** – Generates a log of incoming sentences in the main
   AgOpenGPS folder.
8. **Display Timer Reset** – The extended view remains open for 3 minutes, then
   shrinks to a small view, and then minimizes to the taskbar after another 3
   minutes. Tap this icon to reset the timer.

To hide the full display, tap the blue arrow again or minimize to the tray at
the top.

## Ethernet (UDP) Setup Dialog

![Ethernet Setup Dialog](../img/agio-ethernet-setup.png)

This dialog allows you to configure network adapters and subnets:

1. **Hostname** – The unique name for your computer on the network.
2. **Network Adapters List** – Shows all network adapters, their IP addresses,
   names/types, and packet statistics.
3. **Adapter Filter** – Filter to show only connected/talking adapters or all
   adapters.
4. **Module Connections** – Lists connected modules, their IP addresses, and
   connection status (green = connected).
5. **Subnet** – Displays the subnet of the network adapter that sent a message
   to all connected modules. All devices must be on the same subnet. Tap "fill
   in" to auto-fill #6.
6. **Manual Subnet Entry** – Enter and send a new subnet manually.
7. **Open Windows Network Management** – Launches the Windows Network Management
   App from Control Panel.
8. **Current Subnet** – Shows the current subnet set in AgIO.
9. _(Reserved for future use or additional features)_
10. _(Reserved for future use or additional features)_
11. **Set Subnet** – Sets the subnet address for AgIO and sends it to modules.
    The indicators should turn green if successful.
12. **Return to Main Display** – Go back to the main AgIO display.

## Serial Connections

![Serial Connections](../img/agio-gps.png)

This section covers connecting serial devices:

1. **Serial Port Selection** – Choose the serial COM port and baud rate, then
   tap the green connect button to connect to a serial GPS unit.
2. **RTK via Serial/USB** – Connect here if using RTK through a serial or USB
   port.
3. **Module Connections** – Connect modules here. Plug in one at a time to
   identify each, then connect.
4. **Add USB COM Port** – If you connect an additional USB COM port, tap here to
   add it to the list of available connections.

## RTK

This section explains RTK configuration:

![RTK Settings](../img/agio-rtk.png)

1. **NTRIP Toggle** – Enable or disable NTRIP (Networked Transport of RTCM via
   Internet Protocol).
2. **Computer Name and Networks** – Displays your computer name and all active
   networks.
3. **Caster Address** – Enter the IP or URL of your caster website.
4. **Verify Caster** – Tap to verify the caster site is accessible. The IP will
   be displayed.
5. **Caster Credentials** – Enter your caster username and password.
6. **Get Source Table** – Retrieves a list of available mounts for the caster.
   Select the appropriate one.
7. **Caster Port** – The port used by the caster (default is 2101).

![RTK Position Settings](../img/agio-rtk-position.png)

1. **Manual Fix Entry** – Enter the current fix manually. Select manual or use
   GPS Fix.
2. **Use Current GPS Fix** – Tap here to fill in the manual fix entry with the
   current GPS fix.
3. **RTK Output Method** – Select whether to send RTK via serial or UDP, and
   specify the port. Disable unused methods.
4. **GGA Interval** – Set how often a GGA sentence is sent to the caster. More
   frequent updates use more data. Set this to 0 to disable.
