## Overview

In order to run the AgOpenGPS software, you will require a Windows tablet that
can run the software, and easily be used by you to interact with the software.

## Model Selection

You want a tablet that's rugged and has a screen that won't be impaired in
direct sunlight. The **Panasonic Toughpad** range can be bought very cheaply,
refurbished, on ebay. Above 400 nits is a good experience.

Look for one with at least 8gb memory, preferably an SSD hard drive and if you
can find one with built-in ethernet all the better (otherwise you'll need a USB
dongle to connect it to the AOG board). Ideally, an HD screen (1920x1080) would
be good, but the standard 1366x768 is still OK for AOG.

Make sure it has wifi for tethering to your phone, or USB for a hard-tether if
not (preferably not of course).

**MOST IMPORTANTLY - it must be a WINDOWS tablet. Android will NOT work.** The
version of Windows isn't important, 10 or 11 will be fine. A tablet that uses
the ARM processors is also not suitable - Intel or AMD only I'm afraid.

Make sure you get a charger, and you may need to go looking for a 12V charger as
well of course (unless your machine has a 110/240V inverter?). If you find the
right seller, you can even claim the VAT back.

## Models of note:

- Panasonic Toughpad CF-D1 (1280x720 - on the limit for screen size)
- Panasonic Toughpad FZ-G1 (1920x1200)
- Panasonic Toughbook FZ-G2 (1920x1080, well spec'd usually)
- Panasonic Toughpad FZ-M1 (7" screen, a little small)
- Dell 5290

## Models to stay away from

- Panasonic FZ-A1 (android, no use!)

## Charger for the tablet:

Most tablets that come with USB-C require charging from 20V and require a 45-65W
charger. As most of us has 12V only in the cab finding a charger can be tricky.
These are the ones tested and working with Panasonic, _though note that you can
run Panasonic direct from battery using
[these plugs](https://cpc.farnell.com/pro-power/ppw00029/lead-dc-power-2-5mm-plug-to-plug/dp/PW03428),
no need for charger_ :
