## Motor? Nah - hydraulic please!

This still needs Cytron MD13S :) but we'll move valves instead of motors

So, if your system is compatible, you can likely steer it directly without a
motor turning the steering wheel.

Motor settings are follow:

- Proportional gain - depends on the size of the piston:
  - 15 for small tractors
  - 40 for the big ones
- The maximum Limit maxPWM - depends on the size of the piston 100-180
- The minimum to move minPWM is 38-40

## How to choose a valve?

There are a few kind of valves depending on the Orbit installed. Hydraulic
valves can be purchased from

- https://navisklep.pl/en/k/hydraulic-blocks-hydraulic-valves/
- https://97431270.shop.strato.com/c/complete-hydraulic-system

Take a look at your Orbitrol:

- 4 hoses then you'll need an OC valve and will be connected between the pump /
  steer lines.
- 5 hoses will be an LS system and needs an LS valve with "Tee" connection and
  will be connected parallel to the P / T lines and between the LS / steer
  lines.
- !!! some of the tractors require special valves, for example:
  - Fendt (static)
  - [John Deere 4XXX](https://discourse.agopengps.com/t/hydraulic-valve-assemblies-for-every-tractor-for-every-type-of-hydraulic-system/8011/586?u=bgunics)
  - CASE Quadtrack (90L) require special valves !!! Double check on these.

The valve flow depends on the tractor size. 150-200HP tractors will likely need
60liter. The forum might have tips on this. If unsure add a note about your
tractor to the order!

- 2 is a logic valve, it basically makes a small LS closed centre system inside
  this valve block for the autosteer. This valve will keep the P line a few bar
  higher than the internal LS line (in other words a few bar higher than what is
  needed to operate the wheels at the current time)

- 1 is a relief valve used to limit the maximum pressure for the steering, when
  this valve is tripped the LS line canâ€™t go any higher and the valve 2 will let
  the oil out the T port

- The pressure sensor is connected to the valve block T line, this line is
  connected to the P port of the orbital and because it is open centre the oil
  free flows to tank. But when you turn the steering wheel the pressure in this
  line rises as oil is needed to turn the wheels, because the orbital steering
  lines are blocked this pressure rises quickly and the sensor trips to tell
  autosteer to stop steering

## Installation

Electrical connection(s)
![image](../../img/hydraulic-block-electrical-connection.png) Theoretically the
FET should be capable to handle the power to lock the valve. In practice we've
seen smoke in some cases. Best practice is to add a relay controlled by the Lock
pin.

There are 2 kind of "pressure" check valves:

### Count type

The one with 2 pins needs to be connected between Ground and Pres/Rem
connection. The sensor is a SUCO 166 416 0 31 063 NC

![image](../../img/2pin-count-check-valve.png)

The PCB jumpers must be configured as Remote.

![image](../../img/count-check-valve-jumper.png)

AgOpenGPS must be configured as "Turn sensor" with value as "1". (it only clicks
once)

![image](../../img/agopengps-turn-sensor.png)

### Pressure type

The one with 3 pins uses an AMP Superseal 3pn 1.5 connector and requires 5V from
PCB (WAS 5V could be used).

The sensor is: 0606-25209-B-007 Pressure Transmitter 0 bar - 250 bar 0.5-4.5V
Ratiometric NPT1/4 AMPSuperseal 1.5 17-4PH Stainless Steel Cell

![image](../../img/3pin-pressure-check-valve.png)

The PCB jumpers must be configured as Pressure.

AgOpenGPS must be configured as Pressure with value accordingly.(~10% is
equivalent as 0bar)

![image](../../img/amp-superseal-pinout.png)

pinout is:

- pin1 -> signal
- pin2 -> GND
- pin3 -> 5V

[AgOpenGPS software configuration is explained in detail here](/software/04.-AgOpenGPS-Orientation#steer-configuration)

# Plugs that are of use

If you have the two-pin plug for left/right solenoids, you can use these (TE
part 718-6867) to connect:

https://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/automotive-connectors/7186867

![image](../../img/plug-te-718-6867.png)

If you want to use 3-pin plugs for the lock valves that have the schotky diode
built in, use these Molex part S28200TC310R):
