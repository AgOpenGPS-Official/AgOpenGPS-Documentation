The original Danfoss solution was a 3-wire installation.

The danfoss valve was the original integrated autosteer valve. Theyâ€™ve been used
by Deere, Agco, CNH, etc.

It would have been the easiest way for a tractor manufacturer to add an
autosteer valve, the valve is built right into the steer motor. No additional
plumbing is required. If you have one of these, you do not need a Cytron, but
your board must have the TC4227 (PCB4.1) chip installed. JLCPCB will fit these
to version 4 builds if they're in stock at time of ordering them.

Instead of sending a typical left or right PWM signal down separate channels,
what they do instead is energise (or unlock) the Danfoss with the right channel
and send a varying PWM signal down the left channel, where 50% is straight
ahead, approx 15-25% is full left and 75-85% is full right (this is part of the
safety systems to prevent shorts and such like causing unintended movement).
Saying it again, the LEFT output therefore steers both left and right. Gnd must
also be supplied of course. You should not power the lock via a relay, but drive
from the board.

To use this configuration, your machine must have this kind of valve, you need
the chip on the board and you need the jumpers positioned on the board at
(picture).
