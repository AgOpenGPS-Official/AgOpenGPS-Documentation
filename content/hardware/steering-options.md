# What are my options for steering the tractor???

You've come to the right place. This short page will give you some suggestions
on what kit you will need in order to get up and running. Take some notes here,
then use along with the other pages to work it out.

## <span style="color:lightgreen;">A windows tablet!</span>

Currently, AOG is only supported under Windows - so go read up on suggested
windows tablet models [here](Other-components/tablet). Having a windows tablet
is applicable to all situations.

## My tractor is steer-ready and I believe it can be done via CANBUS.

For this, you will want the CANBUS (aka "Tony's board") PCB. The board is
self-assembly. It's pretty easy to do, but if you're not keen, ask in the forum
or the telegram channel for help. The information for how to build the board is
[here](https://github.com/AgOpenGPS-Official/Boards/tree/main/CANBUS/PCB). You
will also need the [Teensy](Other-components/teensy-4.1), the
[F9P (micro is recommended)](Other-components/gps-modules-standard-or-micro), an
[antenna](Other-components/Choosing-an-Antenna) and the
[BNO085](Other-components/imu-inertial-measurement-unit)

## My tractor has a steering valve, but it's not CANBUS. I believe it's a standard PWM-style hydraulic valve

For this, you will want the standard (All-in-one 4.x)
[PCB](<boards/All-In-One-(AIO)-boards/AIO-Board-flavours>). The board can be
ordered mostly pre-assembled. You will also need the
[Teensy](Other-components/teensy-4.1), the
[F9P (micro or standard, depending on the board)](Other-components/gps-modules-standard-or-micro),
an [antenna](Other-components/Choosing-an-Antenna), a
[Cytron](Other-components/cytron-motor-driver), a
[wheel angle sensor](Other-components/wheel-angle-sensor) (if you can't use the
one on the tractor) and the
[BNO085](Other-components/imu-inertial-measurement-unit)

## My tractor isn't steer-ready, I want to use the Keya steering wheel

For this, you will want the standard (All-in-one 4.x)
[PCB](<boards/All-In-One-(AIO)-boards/AIO-Board-flavours>). The board can be
ordered mostly pre-assembled. You will also need the
[Teensy](Other-components/teensy-4.1), the
[F9P (micro or standard, depending on the board)](Other-components/gps-modules-standard-or-micro),
an [antenna](Other-components/Choosing-an-Antenna), a
[Cytron](Other-components/cytron-motor-driver), a
[wheel angle sensor](Other-components/wheel-angle-sensor) (if you can't use the
one on the tractor), the [Keya motorised wheel](Other-components/Keya) and the
[BNO085](Other-components/imu-inertial-measurement-unit)

## My tractor isn't steer-ready, I want to fit my own hydraulic valve block

For this, you will want the standard (All-in-one 4.x)
[PCB](<boards/All-In-One-(AIO)-boards/AIO-Board-flavours>). The board can be
ordered mostly pre-assembled. You will also need the
[Teensy](Other-components/teensy-4.1), the
[F9P (micro or standard, depending on the board)](Other-components/gps-modules-standard-or-micro),
an [antenna](Other-components/Choosing-an-Antenna), a
[Cytron](Other-components/cytron-motor-driver), a
[wheel angle sensor](Other-components/wheel-angle-sensor) (if you can't use the
one on the tractor), the
[Baraki valve](Other-components/Hydraulic-steering-with-baraki-valve) and the
[BNO085](Other-components/imu-inertial-measurement-unit)

## My tractor isn't steer-ready, I want to fit my own wheel motor

For this, you will want the standard (All-in-one 4.x)
[PCB](<boards/All-In-One-(AIO)-boards/AIO-Board-flavours>). The board can be
ordered mostly pre-assembled. You will also need the
[Teensy](Other-components/teensy-4.1), the
[F9P (micro or standard, depending on the board)](Other-components/gps-modules-standard-or-micro),
an [antenna](Other-components/Choosing-an-Antenna), a
[Cytron](Other-components/cytron-motor-driver), a
[wheel angle sensor](Other-components/wheel-angle-sensor) (if you can't use the
one on the tractor), the [motor](Other-components/the-motor) and the
[BNO085](Other-components/imu-inertial-measurement-unit)
