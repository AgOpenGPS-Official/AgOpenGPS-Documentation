**These fixed are for v4.1 STD / Standard only**

**v4.5 boards do NOT need these fixes!!**

The trace next to the ampseal is touching the direct 12V input, so for 24V
motors please cut the trace. For valves / 12V motor the outside 12V pin will
power your cytron directly. (so the label is misleading)
