# Welcome to AgOpenGPS 
AgOpenGPS is an open-source precision agriculture platform that brings low-cost GPS-based autosteer to your farm equipment.

Information about the project is spread across a few different sources — this documentation is designed to **tie it all together** and help you get started quickly.

The good news is, if you are new here, you are in the right place. This documentation serves as a guide to the world of AgOpenGPS, and is the perfect place to get started.

## 🧭 New Here? Start Here

This site is the **official documentation hub**, and it's the best place to:
- Understand what AgOpenGPS does
- Find the hardware and software you’ll need
- Learn how to install, build, and test your system
- Access other resources in the AgOpenGPS ecosystem

## Project Repositories
There are 2 central repositories for AgOpenGPS on Github:
1) The software repository (containing the computer programs you will need to download onto your in-machine device to achieve autosteer)
2) The Hardware and Firmware repository (containing files which help build physical items (e.g., PCB design files) or program components (e.g., make your Teensy work with your project setup))

## 📚 Contents

This documentation is organized into two main areas: **Software** and **Hardware**. Below are the key resources to help you get started, build, and maintain your AgOpenGPS system.
