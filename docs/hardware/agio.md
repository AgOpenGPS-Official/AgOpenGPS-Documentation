AgIO is the program that runs on your tablet and acts as the communication layer between AgOpenGPS and whatever steering board you have built.

Whether using USB, or ethernet, its role is the same - to take messages from hardware to software. Without AgIO running, AgOpenGPS will be running blind and won't know where it is, or how to steer the machine. You can start it and minimise it.
