If you get this message:

It means one of the following:
* AGIO isn't running - ensure it is started by pressing the green button next to the arrow
* if it is running, but you're still getting that message, ensure AGIO is talking to your steering board
  * this could mean checking your network settings - see [here](https://github.com/farmerbriantee/AgOpenGPS/wiki/05.-Ethernet-Setup)
* it could also mean AGIO is running, and your computer is talking to it - but it can't find a valid location. Ensure your antennas are outside and have a clear view of the sky

Remember, this message doesn't just mean "is AGIO running?". What it really means is "I don't know where in the world I am" and as above, that could be for a number of reasons.
